    "One of the most important aspects of any business is ensuring your customer base is happy and will remain using your services. Customers are likely to turn over and switch providers as a result of poor service, high pricing, and other aspects that may infuriate them.If we can predict which customers are most at risk of leaving our services, we can make efforts to improve our relationship with them and help improve our chances of retaining them as customers. We can also attempt to identify what are the primary causes for our customers leaving.\n",
